The market's growth is also supported by the rising trend of digitization in facilities operations, enabling businesses to manage resources more effectively and reduce operational costs. North America and Europe are currently leading the FM market, owing to mature infrastructure and the early adoption of innovative technologies. However, emerging economies in Asia-Pacific and Latin America are expected to show the highest growth rates due to rapid urbanization, industrialization, and increasing awareness of efficient building management practices.
